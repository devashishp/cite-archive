Cite and Archive
================

Cite and Archive is a tool to help you archive and generate citation for web pages! Web pages are dynamic and can change over time. Further, linked webpages and projects could get moved or removed over time making your citation useless. Cite and Archive is a tool (not unlike `webcite <https://www.webcitation.org>`) which will archive your link to archive.org and generate a bibliography entry for you.
